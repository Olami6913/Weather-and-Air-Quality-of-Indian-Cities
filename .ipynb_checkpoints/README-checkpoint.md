    "## Introduction\n",
    "This dataset contains weather and air quality of multiple cities in India. it includes observations for key pollutants, meterological variables (temperature, wind speedand direction, humidity, cloud cover, pressure, precipitation), and temporal information (sunrise, sunset, moonrise, moonset).\n",
    "The dataset was collected to monitor urban air quality and understand its relationship with weather conditions, which is critical for public health, urban planning, and environmental policy."

    "## Key Findings\n",
    "Pollutant distribution: PM2.5 and PM10 are right-skewed with higher values in urban hotspots.\n",
    "Weather influence: calm weather conditions are associated with higher pollutant concentrations; wind disperses pollutants effectively.\n",
    "Temporal patterns: PM2.5 shows diurnal variation, peaking during early morning hours. \n",
    "Spatial patterns: Significant variation across cities; some locations consistently show higher average pollutant levels."
